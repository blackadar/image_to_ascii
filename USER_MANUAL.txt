-----ASCII Art Generator User Manual-------------------------------------------

Created by Brian Hurley & Jordan Blackadar
Professor: Dr. Ming Zhang
Class: COMP-3800-07 Image Processing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE

1. Open the file "gui.mlapp" using MATLAB version 2019a or later. 

2. Click on the "Source" button on the top right and select your input image.

3. Adjust any settings on the bottom to your preference, the default settings
work well for most images. See the settings section below for more info. 

4. Select the "Process" button on the right to generate the ASCII art from the
image, the result will be saved to the same directory the image is from. 

5. Select "Open Results" to launch notepad.exe and open the resulting .txt 
file from your most recent run. 

6. (Optional) Select the "Show Intermediates" button to show the pre-processing
steps that were taken on the image before it was converted to ASCII characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST IMAGES

All test images are located in the "data" folder with the results as .txt files
located in the "results" folder. The photos named "challenge_X.png" show the 
intermediate pre-processing steps that are taken before the image is converted
into ASCII. All results except for "wit.jpg.txt" were run using the default 
settings, "wit.jpg.txt" was run with Output Columns set to 256. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETTINGS

Ramp Size: Set to "Small" or "Large", this allows you to pick if you would like
to use a wider or smaller range of ASCII characters when converting the pixel
intensities to ASCII. 

Histogram Equlization: Enable this to even out the contrast in the image, this
is useful if the input image is either too bright or too dark. 

UnSharp Masking: Enable this to sharpen the edges of the image, this makes the
edges much clearer to see when the image is converted to ASCII.

Output Columns: Set to a values within the range of 1-1000, this sets the 
number of columns of ASCII characters in the resulting .txt file. Limited due
to MATLAB performance reasons. 

Scale: Set to a value from 0.0-1.0 to adjust the aspect ratio of the resulting
ASCII art. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTES

- Make sure that when you are viewing the resulting .txt files that you have 
notepad or any other text editor set to not have "word wrap" enabled. 

- Some fonts have different spacing and this can cause the ASCII art to look
malformed, we recommned you use the font Consolas to avoid this.
